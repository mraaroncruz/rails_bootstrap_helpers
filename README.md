# RailsBootstrapHelpers

Some helpful Twitter Bootstrap Rails helpers.  I felt the pain of the upgrade from Twitter Bootstrap 1.4 to 2.0 and these were the result.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rails_bootstrap_helpers'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Helper methods will be available in your views!

## Usage

Read the helper methods in `app/helpers/rails_bootstrap_helpers/layout_helper.rb`.  I will add examples if I get any watchers on this repo.

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
